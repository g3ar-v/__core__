## Trevor

A modular AI based on mycroft AI

## Components

- Skill (Main processing unit)
- Intent parser (Adapt and Padatious)
- Automatic Speech Recognition/STT (Mycroft precise)
- TTS/Speech Synthesis (Mimic 3)
- Wakeword Listener (precise)

## Goal

Just like car parts. You would remove a part and replace with a similar part. To run
both Mycroft and OVOS skills.

- modularity
- compatibility with both MycroftAI and OVOS skills
